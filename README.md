## About Symfony

- Symfony is a set of PHP Components, a Web Application framework, a Philosophy, and a Community — all working together in harmony,Symfony is a PHP framework for web applications and a set of reusable PHP components. Symfony is used by thousands of web applications (including BlaBlaCar.com and Spotify.com) and most of the [popular PHP projects](https://symfony.com/projects) (including Drupal and Magento).
  Symfony was released in 2005 and has made a long way to win the reputation of the most mature and reliable PHP framework. It is the number 1 choice for the enterprise web applications. And here is [why](https://hackernoon.com/7-good-reasons-to-use-symfony-framework-for-your-project-265f96dcf759):

- High flexibility:
   1) Symfony is one of the most feature-rich PHP frameworks. The two most outstanding technological benefits of Symfony that make it so awesome are Bundles and Components.
   
   2) The bundle is almost the same as a plugin. Regard it like a package of files (PHP files, stylesheets, JavaScripts, images) for implementing any feature (for ex, a blog, a shopping cart etc). The main benefit of bundles is that they are decoupled. You can reconfigure and reuse them for many applications to reduce the overall development cost.
   
   3) The components are generic features that reduce the routine tasks and allow developers to focus on specific business features. There are 30 helpful Symfony components that facilitate the development process. You can use components independently and add your own custom modules with no trouble to the architecture. Symfony components can also be used stand-alone in other frameworks (for ex., Laravel) or in plain PHP solutions.
   
   4) Bundles and components help to eliminate strict dependencies in the architecture. The fewer dependencies you have, the easier it will be to make changes without risk of breaking other parts of the system. Thus, you can adapt the solution to any requirements and user scenarios to create a highly flexible application.
- Company behind the technology:
   
   1) Symfony is one of few frameworks that are commercially supported. SensioLabs, the company-creator, and sponsor, actively contributes to its reputation. They provide official tutorials and certification. In the Company website, you will find a schedule of the upcoming conferences all over the world. This shows the scale and seriousness of their intentions and beliefs.
-  Proven reliability:
   
   1) Symfony has proven its reliability over time while many other frameworks failed. Many notable platforms as phpBB, Drupal, Magento, and eZ Publish use its components
- Easy testing:
   
   1) Each new line of code should be tested to guarantee stable work of an application. Reusing of bundles, an absence of strict dependencies and possibility to create design patterns contribute to better maintainability and testing in Symfony. Unit testing is very easy because of using PHPUnit independent library. Functional testing is also automated to reduce the developer’s routine.
- Long-term support:
   
   1) Symfony is a stable and well-tested framework with regular updates. The most recent versions stay long-term supported and compatible with the newer releases: up to 3 years for some of the versions.
- Large community:
   
   1) One of the influential aspects for a framework survivability is a good community. The official website declares 2000+ contributors (1734 on Github) in their community. This number is several times bigger than that of other PHP frameworks communities.
   2) Why community matters? Not only the core developers work on improvements. Symfony is an open-source. This means that PHP experts and enthusiasts from all over the world take part in making the code better for everybody. In the community, people cooperate with each other. They create new components, try to solve emerged issues, or help others with advice.
- Good documentation:
   
   1) Incomplete or outdated documentation is a problem of many technologies. Symfony documentation is considered one of the best, compared to the documentation of other PHP frameworks. It is clearly written, well-structured, supplied with eхamples, and updated from version to version. You can find an explanation of every component and the development process as a whole.


## Learning Symfony

- Symfony has the most extensive and thorough documentation and video tutorial library of any modern web application framework. The [Symfony documentation](https://symfony.com/doc/current/index.html#gsc.tab=0) is thorough, complete, and makes it a breeze to get started learning the framework.
- there are some videos help you to [learn Symfony](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbR_t0NLAA2NpymV0rPLr-D_GiKK8owNu).

## Installation

[Install Symfony](https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup.html) with Composer (see [requirements details](https://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/requirements.html)).
Symfony follows the [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) strictly, publishes "Long Term Support" (LTS) versions and has a [release process](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/community/releases.html) that is predictable and business-friendly.
and there are some notes you need to compelete your symfony project coreectly:

- To make entity: 
  - php bin/console make:entity
- To make migration:
  - php bin/console make:migration
  - php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
- To use annotation:
  - composer require annotations
- To make controller:
  - php bin/console make:controller


## Documentation

- Read the [Getting Started guide](https://symfony.com/doc/current/page_creation.html) if you are new to Symfony.
- Try the [Symfony Demo application](https://github.com/symfony/demo) to learn Symfony in practice.
- Master Symfony with the [Guides and Tutorials](https://symfony.com/doc/current/index.html#gsc.tab=0), the [Components docs](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/index.html) and the [Best Practices](https://symfony.com/doc/current/best_practices/index.html) reference.

## Community

- [Join the Symfony Community](https://symfony.com/community) and meet other members at the [Symfony events](https://symfony.com/events/).
